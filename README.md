# Basic App (Sidemenu)

This repository contains the required code to run a very basic mobile web app with Meteor, Angular and Ionic.

In the last few month, there have been a few breaking changes in these frameworks (Meteor 1.3 and Angular 1.5, I'm looking at you). But last thing you want to deal with, when you try to prototype an idea for an app, is to spend three days figuring out the latest changes in the current versions of your frameworks, so here is your starting point!

## Latest Versions
Meteor: 1.3.2.4

Angular: 1.5.3

Ionic: 1.3.1

## Acknowledgment
The ['WhatsApp' clone by Eytan Manor](https://github.com/DAB0mB/angular-meteor-whatsapp) was my starting point for creating this repository.
